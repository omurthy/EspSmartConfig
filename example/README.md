# Examples for using the `esptouch_flutter` plugin

The example app demonstrates how to use the [`esptouch_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/esptouch_flutter) plugin.

You can read the full source code on GitHub: [`example` folder](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/tree/master/example) in the `esptouch_flutter` repository. This example is a fully-configurable, fully-functional ESP Touch app that lets you configure all parameters and WiFi details (with the option of automatically recognizing the current network).

There is also another example app that is available and it's available at [`smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter_kotlin_example`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter_kotlin_example). It's a much simpler app and you will need to edit the source code in order to enter the WiFi credentials to the simple example app.

The example app lets you configure

* WiFi SSID (WiFi name)
* WiFi BSSID (MAC of the wireless access point)
* Password
* Duration of the task
* Expected task count
* ... many more.

You can use current network SSID/BSSID or enter it manually (getting wifi info is restricted on the platforms, so sometimes it's necessary to enter them manually).

You can run the example app by:

```
flutter packages get
cd example
flutter run
```

### Screenshots

When you run the example app, this is more or less what you should expect:


#### Simple config

Set WiFi details, such as name, address and password. All fields are editable.

#### Advanced config

You can configure all task parameters right from your Flutter app. This level of configurability is not even supported in the official example apps.

### Code snippets

In the code example, I specify the types for clarity. You can omit them as Dart can infer them.

```dart
import 'package:esptouch_flutter/esptouch_flutter.dart';

// Somewhere in your widget...
final ESPTouchTask task = ESPTouchTask(
  ssid: 'My WiFi network',
  bssid: 'ab:cd:ef:12:23:34',
  password: 'I love SMAHO',
);
final Stream<ESPTouchResult> stream = task.execute();
StreamSubscription<ESPTouchResult> streamSubscription = stream.listen((ESPTouchResult result) {
  print('Configured IP: ${result.ip} MAC: ${result.bssid}');
});
// Don't forget to cancel your stream subscription:
streamSubscription.cancel();
```

If you would like to customize the task, provide `ESPTouchTaskParameter` instance as `taskParameter` to `ESPTouchTask`.

```dart
final ESPTouchTask task = ESPTouchTask(
  ssid: 'My WiFi network',
  bssid: 'ab:cd:ef:12:23:34',
  password: 'The esptouch flutter plugin is awesome',
  taskParameter: ESPTouchTaskParameter(waitUdpReceiving: Duration(hour: 12)),
);
// You can still stop the task at any point by calling .cancel on the stream subscription:
streamSubscription.cancel();
```

In a real world example, you could display the result to the user, save it locally in SQLite or send it to your backend.

## Get WiFi details

Quite often, you want to provide an easy way for getting the *current WiFi network's* SSID and BSSID. **Use the [`connectivity`](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity) plugin for discovering the state of the network (WiFi & mobile/cellular) connectivity on Android and iOS.**

In the example app, we wrote the platform-specific code that fetches the WiFi details instead of using the `connectivity` plugin. See what you need to add to your platform code in [`MainActivity.java`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/blob/master/example/android/app/src/main/java/com/smaho/eng/esptouchexample/MainActivity.java) and [`AppDelegate.m`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m). For most cases, though, I recommend you to use the `connectivity` plugin, as it's well tested, frequently updated and it's maintained by the Flutter team.
